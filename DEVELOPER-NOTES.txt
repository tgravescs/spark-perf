# This is a check-list of config vars that need to be updated after developers update their
# config.py file by copying an updated config.py.template. These are the lines to paste into
# config.py replacing the default lines that exist.

SPARK_CONF_DIR = "YOUR LOCAL DIR HERE"

# The following trick might not work for you depending on your dev station network config.

Remove this line (unless you actually have 9gb of memory and want to use it):
JavaOptionSet("spark.executor.memory", ["9g"])',

Might want to update these:
SKIP_SPARK_PREP = True
SKIP_TEST_PREP = True
SKIP_DISK_WARMUP = True

If you are not skipping the spark pref: SPARK_SKIP_PREP = False, you may want to set SPARK_HOME_DIR
to be spark-perf/spark
